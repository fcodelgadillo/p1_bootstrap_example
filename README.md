A simple bootstrap web page


In this project I built a web page about a fictitious JS conf with fictional characters just to make use of bootstrap technology.

The web page is simple, but friendly. There are some displayable menus, a modal window that appears when you click 'Register Now' or 'Don’t Miss Out Register Now!'. You can navigate scrolling, using the navigation menu and even jump to the 'Speakers' section by clicking 'See Speakers'. Finally, if you click the “Presented by” you will be redirected to my Personal website. At first, using bootstrap can seem different, but like any other technology is just conquering the learning process. Once you get used to it, you see the advantages and disadvantages of using it. While some may see that is a heavy and not original stuff, it can save you a lot of time.
